*Note: As is the case when installing any new plugin, it's always a good idea to backup your blog data before installing.*

1. After downloading the Kommiku plugin, unpack and upload the folder, "kommiku", to the wp-content/plugins folder on your blog. Make sure to leave the directory structure of the archive intact so that all of the Kommiku files are located in 'wp-content/plugins/kommiku/'

2. Activate the plugin. And you should be good to go :)
